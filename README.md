# IOT-Project
I have made an IOT project of Fire Alarm System Project by Interfacing Arduino with Temperature and Gas Sensor using TinkerCad

[This is the link for the Tinkercad project](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/d7whCDPmXLc-spectacular-migelo-allis/editel?sharecode=N5_DeIIJ7lIS-caGk2KkkHjfqDEP1JwvIqqj3OQ12YQ)

Plus i have created a thingspeak http request of Tesla shares.
